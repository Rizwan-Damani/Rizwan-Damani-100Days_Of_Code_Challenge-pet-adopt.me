pet Adoption page in HTML &amp; CSS

Explanation:
HTML:
    The page starts with standard metadata and includes a link to an external stylesheet (style.css).
    It contains headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>) for titles and subtitles, and two pet cards (<div class="card">) under the #pets container.

CSS:
    .card: Defines styling for the pet cards, including width, border, border radius, padding, and margin.
    img: Ensures images inside .card containers fill their respective cards and have rounded corners.
    h2, span, h3, h4: Sets styles for different headings and spans.
    #pets: Uses flexbox to arrange pet cards with space-evenly distribution.
    @media (max-width: 375px): Media query to make the #pets container wrap its contents when the viewport width is 375px or smaller, allowing for a responsive layout on smaller screens.
    This setup creates a visually appealing and responsive webpage for a pet adoption service, showcasing pets (Jerry the dog and Tom the cat) with their descriptions and encouraging 
    adoption with emotive language and design elements.
